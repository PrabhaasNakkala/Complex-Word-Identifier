# Complex-Word-Identifier

The idea of this project is to scan a research paper pdf and identify a few of the most complicated words in the document and generate definitions for those words. This will help people read complicated research papers with unfamiliar terminology. 

# How To Run It

The first step is to download the research paper of your choice in pdf format. Navigate to the Main.py file and change the PdfName varaible to the name of the pdf that you downloaded.

Secondly, adjust the number of words to generate by changing the NumberOfWords variable. Run the Main.py file and a dictionary of the words with definitions will be printed to the terminal.
