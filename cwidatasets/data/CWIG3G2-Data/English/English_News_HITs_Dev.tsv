3MYASTQBG7CKGRM1SSVJ3FQ3Q8YDQY	The new requirement could amount to 35 billion euros, said business daily Cinco Dias. That is in addition to the 53.8 billion euros in provisions already demanded in a reform announced in February. Rajoy's conservative government had instilled markets with a brief dose of confidence by stepping into Bankia, performing a U-turn on its refusal to spend public money to rescue banks. The government would take control stake by converting a state-backed loan of 4.465 billion euros ($5.8 billion) into shares in the bank's parent company, and it reportedly may boost the total investment to 7-10 billion euros. But the transaction, announced late Wednesday, has also refocussed attention on the Spanish banks' problems, and the potential costs to a conservative government determined to slash spending. 
32XN26MTXZKFQA5UOBZS7M7QMD2L0O	By late morning, Santander, the eurozone's biggest bank by capital, had slumped 2.97 percent to 4.774 euros, number-two BBVA slid 2.62 percent to 5.171 euros and Banco Popular skidded 3.75 percent to 2.08 euros. Bankia, in which the state is taking a 45-percent stake as a crisis measure to save it from crippling bad loans, fell 2.14 percent to 2.06 euros, bringing losses this week to 16.26 percent. Created from a merger of seven savings banks, Bankia had 37.5 billion euros in exposure to the property sector at the end of 2011, of which 31.8 billion euros were classed as problematic. But the hangover from the property party extends across the financial sector. Bank of Spain figures show commercial banks held problematic real estate assets including loans and seized property of 184 billion euros, 60 percent of their property portfolio at the end of 2011. 
3D3B8GE892SNDP85GZBSHEH3V409PG	On Facebook, more than 10,000 people signed up to a page announcing an opposition rally for Saturday. Authorities said on Tuesday at least 51,500 police officers and 2,000 interior ministry troops have been deployed in Moscow since the election. At least 300 people were detained by police at a protest in central Moscow on Tuesday night that included flare-type fireworks thrown at a group of pro-Kremlin youth, said a city police spokesman, Maxim Kolosvetov. Russian news agencies reported about demonstrators d200 were arrested at a similar attempt to hold an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg and another 25 in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don. The Moscow protest ended after nearly four hours; the other rallies were broken up by police. 
3GONHBMNHVZWYDT5SHDZDYP141QMZM	The agreement was long sought by the U.S.-backed government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the perpetually skittish leader who has publicly voiced fears of what would befall his country if the United States quickly packed up and left. "I recognize that many Americans are tired of war," Obama said in the speech. "But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan and end this war responsibly." The larger rationale of the agreement was to reassure Afghan leaders that the United States would not repeat the mistake it made following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. Then, Washington withdrew support for anti-Soviet militia forces in Afghanistan and set the stage for Taliban rule. The Taliban then allowed al-Qaida to use the country to plan the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
3YLTXLH3DF7GSVQOEBZKUVFREH8PHM	Also Sunday, two Turkish journalists who had been detained in Syria for two months arrived in Istanbul on a plane from Iran after that country helped negotiate their release by Syrian authorities. Journalists Adem Ozkose and Hamit Coskun were abducted by militiamen who had blocked a road and were stopping cars and abducting passengers, Ozkose told reporters in Istanbul on Sunday. He and Coskun were later held separately at a prison in Damascus, where they slept on a concrete floor, had no sunlight and lost track of the days. "Finding out what day it was made me happy. It made me appreciate freedom. Thank God we were saved, but there are many others inside Syria waiting for freedom," he said. 
3BO3NEOQM0I91MV6VAZ84CRBF8NAIK	Google's relations with China have been strained since it moved its search engine out of the country two years ago in a dispute over censorship and security. Google spokeswoman Niki Fenwick says the Chinese government cleared the deal on Saturday. The deal allows Google to expand into manufacturing phones, tablet computers and other consumer devices for the first time. Google also gets access to more than 17,000 Motorola patents. The deal is expected to close early next week. Airport officials say that Israel's ambassador to Egypt has returned to Cairo after he and other embassy staffers fled on military planes when thousands of angry Egyptians attacked the embassy in September. An official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press said Yitzhak Levanon returned to Cairo Sunday through Istanbul. 
3G57RS03HH68KV5NBBNZ9L48XX1527	Witnesses said the insurgents were dressed completely in Islamic veils to conceal their weapons, the Journal said. One insurgent detonated a car bomb that destroyed the main gate and at least two insurgents entered the compound and took over a laundry and maintenance building. Suicide bombers attacked a compound housing Westerners in Kabul on Wednesday hours after U.S. President Barack Obama signed a security pact during a short visit to a city that remains vulnerable to a resilient insurgency. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack which involved a car bomb and insurgents disguised as women on the eastern outskirts of the capital, killing seven people, a Gurkha guard and six passers-by, and wounding 17. The Taliban said it was in response to Obama's visit and to the strategic partnership deal he signed with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a pact that sets out a long-term U.S. role after most foreign combat troops leave by the end of 2014. 
3L4YG5VW9NTQRIIWN6PZ3GJ486CDDN	Shortly afterward, three children knocked on the neighbour's door and said they had been shot, Lt Goodyear said. Thomas came outside and called for her children to come back to the house. They obeyed and went home, according to Lt Goodyear. The neighbour then heard more gunshots and called 911 again. When police arrived on the scene at 4.54am, they found 17-year-old Pebbles Johnson suffering from gunshot wounds outside and heard four shots from inside the house. The teen was taken to an ambulance in a police car, but she died before the ambulance reached the hospital. Thomas then emerged with a gun, saw more police approaching her home and went back inside. At 5.26am, one final gunshot was heard, Lt Goodyear said. 
3NCN4N1H1GI6YXBPY4CW4V7YICZNBE	Fighting flared in Tripoli again on Monday leaving one person dead and nine wounded, a security official told AFP. He said the victim died in the neighbourhood of Jabal Mohsen, populated mainly by members of Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Battles first erupted on Saturday between residents of Jabal Mohsen and the nearby neighbourhood of Bab al-Tebbaneh -- populated mainly by Sunni Muslims opposed to Assad's regime -- after security forces arrested a Sunni Islamist on suspicion he was linked to a terrorist organisation. On the diplomatic front, European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday  agreed fresh sanctions against Syria, the 15th round so far to protest the relentless repression of dissidents by Assad's regime. 
3FK4G712NX12VWKWHMFDTER49ZTSSW	Those forces are scheduled to end combat operations after 2014, about thirteen years after the war began. "I recognize that many Americans are tired of war. As president, nothing is more wrenching than signing a letter to a family of the fallen, or looking into the eyes of a child who will grow up without a mother or father," Mr Obama said. Still, the president vowed not to compromise the earlier efforts as he sought to wind down the war. "I will not keep Americans in harm's way a single day longer than is absolutely required for our national security. But we must finish the job we started in Afghanistan and end this war responsibly," he said. The visit is the third trip for Mr. Obama as president, with his most recent time there taking place in late 2010. 
3FI30CQHVKKYRC5XZNQF2KLCNMA6BN	Fierce clashes between regime forces and armed rebels in central Syria Monday killed 23 Syrian soldiers and wounded dozens, a watchdog said, as the EU slapped fresh sanctions on the Damascus regime. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three troop carriers were destroyed in the clashes that began at dawn on the outskirts of Rastan, a city located in restive Homs province. Regime forces launched an offensive on the city at the weekend but have met with sharp resistance from rebels seeking the ouster of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The Observatory said dozens had been wounded in shelling of the city by Syrian troops. Monday's killings come despite a month-old ceasefire brokered by UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan as part of a six-point plan aimed at ending violence that has swept Syria since March last year when a popular revolt erupted against Assad's regime. 
3P6ENY9P79XOB93K1G90LYEFS3DHI2	Israeli Foreign Ministry officials indicated that the visit was a symbolic gesture, meant to signal Jerusalem's desire to return ties with its neighbor to the south to normalcy. However, Shin Bet officials have yet to approve the permanent return of Israel's envoy to Egypt for security reasons. Sources within the Foreign Ministry claimed that Egypt has yet to respond to an Israeli request regarding security arrangements near the ambassador's residence as well regarding the embassy's planned new location. Ya'akov Amitai has been named to replace Levanon as Israel's ambassador, and is expected to enter office in early December. It has not yet been made clear, however, whether the requested security arrangements will be in place at that time. If security will not setup according to Israel's requests at that time, Amitai will arrive to submit his letter of credence, stay in Cairo for a few days, and return to Israel. 
3K1H3NEY7L0T32SNPWQ791M1KLPGD6	The government blames the bloodshed on armed gangs and extremists acting out a foreign plot to destabilize Syria. Tensions stemming from the Syrian uprising also have touched off clashes across the border in Lebanon, in the northern city of Tripoli. Street battles pitting Lebanese Sunnis — who generally support the Syrian uprising — against Alawite supporters of Assad's regime killed one person Monday, raising the death toll to four since Sunday. The clashes began Sunday after authorities detained an anti-Syrian Lebanese national. The violence further undermines a U.N.-backed peace plan that is supposed to bring an end to Syria's deadly crisis. A cease-fire that was supposed to begin on April 12 has had only a limited effect, throwing into doubt the rest of the plan that calls for talks between Assad's regime and those seeking to end his rule. 
3AJA9FLWSCZ4XDCE6QL0ID22BBXIFB	Al Jazeera's Sonia Gallego, reporting from Madrid, said the nationalisation of other banks should not be ruled out as an option yet. "With the gravity of the economic situation [in Spain], it is getting increasingly difficult" for the government to refinance as much of the debt as it can, she said. Spain effectively took over Bankia SA, one of the country's biggest banks, this week after days of market anxiety over the lender's viability. Toxic assets Spain's banks were hit by billions of euros of losses after a decade-long property bubble burst in 2008 and concerns about them, and the country's overspending regional governments have fanned fears of a new eurozone debt crisis. Toxic assets now total 184 billion euros, but many fear the hole is even bigger. 
3ZXNP4Z39RMT8L5E9AK1M1HDU3N7LD	On the anniversary of bin Laden's killing, Crocker said he did not believe there would be a sole turning point in the war. "Al Qaeda is still there. We do feel we are prevailing in this with our Afghan partners," he said. "We cannot be in a position of taking on ourselves bringing perfection to Afghanistan. That has to be left to Afghans." But Crocker said there would be no repeat of the 1990s when a withdrawal of Western backers in the wake of the Soviet withdrawal unleashed a vicious civil war out of which the Taliban and al Qaeda support bases arose. Just hours after President Obama’s plane lifted off from Afghanistan, a bomb rocked Kabul, killing at least seven, a vivid reminder of the challenges that still lay ahead for the country. 
344M16OZKIG450N98VEM53DJL9CNEE	"The general feeling is that Spanish banks have worse problems than previously thought," said Edward Hugh, an independent economist based in Barcelona. In an attempt to soothe markets, the government has said it will approve a reform enabling banks to transfer problem loans to separate agencies. But it has said this will be done without using state money. "What we want is to fix the real price of homes (held by the banks) even if everyone loses money, the developers as well as the banks, and that we put them on sale," Rajoy said this week. The second plank of the reform will be a requirement that banks boost a financial cushion against the threat of losses in their property assets, the Economy Ministry has said. 
3E22YV8GG1782RCZH9UXZFCN0THPNV	The thousands of Russians who rallied in Moscow and St. Petersburg faced off with police and Interior Ministry troops, who detained hundreds of protesters, including journalists. The Russian Union of Journalists on Wednesday condemned police violence and called for a probe into the dozens of attacks and arrests of journalists, describing them as "an attempt to gag and intimidate society." More opposition rallies were expected Wednesday, along with a pro-Putin gathering in central Moscow that had attracted a few hundred people so far. Sunday's parliamentary vote suggested Russians are tiring of Putin and his United Russia party, which has strongly overshadowed all other political forces in Russia for the past dozen years and earned a reputation for corruption. Preliminary results indicate the party won less than 50 per cent of votes, a steep fall from its earlier majority. 
37PGLWGSJT7FDZ4S71CXYQU7J7EIKD	The immediate market reaction to Friday's government announcements was negative. But later the gap between yields on Spanish and German benchmark government bonds - a measure of how risky investors judge lending to Spain to be - narrowed somewhat to 450 basis points and Spanish bluechip shares moderated their fall to 0.76 percent. Banks have until the end of the year to move their holdings of repossessed property into asset management firms for a fire sale, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told a news conference. All banks must do this, he said. The state will put less than 15 billion euros into the latest of the four separate bank rescues that Spain has enacted over the past three years, de Guindos estimated. 
30OITAWPBQ4V08AHXM3N85FC9DQ9HB	The teenage girl shot dead in Bellaghy, County Londonderry, on Saturday morning was 18-year-old Lauren O'Neill. Her 21-year-old sister Brenda remains in a critical condition in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Bellaghy parish priest Fr Andy Dolan said the teenager died trying to protect her sister. They were shot at a house in William Court. The police are continuing to question a 26-year-old man in connection with the incident. Fr Dolan told BBC Radio Ulster: "When Brenda was under attack, Lauren dived in to save her and in the process lost her own life. "I'd say they were close in life and in death couldn't be closer." A man and a woman questioned on suspicion of assisting an offender have been released. 
3PR3LXCWSF0SMYAW2QL9BR36X399X4	Speaking via Skype from Hama, activist Mousab Alhamadee said one local rebel leader was killed alongside five civilians. "He was a hero in the Free Syrian Army who was trying to defend the civilians," he said, referring to the umbrella group of local, anti-regime militias. An amateur video posted online Sunday showed men carrying the dead body of a woman from a house. A second video showed men in a mosque praying over five coffins, three of them open with flowers piled on bodies wrapped in white cloth. The area, a plain of farmland along the Orontes River, is dotted with villages of Christians, Sunni Muslims and Alawites, the offshoot sect of Shiite Islam to which Assad belongs. Alhamadee, who is from a village near al-Tamana, said sectarian tensions were low before the uprising, but have deteriorated as Sunni villages like al-Tamana joined the anti-Assad uprising. 
3OND0WXMHWGCV41Y5XJ90JGN0A6HET	New updates, better-optimized versions of Android may go directly to Motorola, while taking much longer to reach other smartphone manufactures. Google defended itself saying it has no intentions of giving Motorola special treatment over other Android-running OEMs such as HTC, Samsung, and LG. Apparently the argument was enough for Google it get over all of the regulatory hurdles it needed to close the deal. Google is interested in purchasing Motorola mostly for its patents. Now that Google is duking it out in court with Oracle over Java-related patents, it's more important than ever for Google so it can defend itself against future Android lawsuits, VB says. At least 300 people were detained by police at a protest in downtown Moscow on Tuesday night that included flare-type fireworks thrown at a group of pro-Kremlin youth. 
3SV8KD29L4T18PT2750JYLXXFKGKZC	Spain's banks were hit by billions of euros of losses after the bursting of a decade-long property bubble in 2008 and concerns about them, and the country's overspending regional governments, have fanned fears of a new euro zone debt crisis. The toxic assets now total 184 billion euros, but many fear the hole is even bigger. Successive waves of bank sector clean-ups have failed to convince investors. A reform package for Spain's troubled banks, aimed at convincing investors that the sector is solvent and the country has a strategy to avoid a bailout, is expected to be released. The government package is expected to include measures obliging banks to increase provisions against bad loans and possibly plans for the creation of a new entity that would act as a "bad bank". 
3SNR5F7R92UCRZCIBF1U0VH2ZAIIET	Spain is set to present new reforms to complete the clean-up of its banks after difficult last-minute talks between the government and lenders. The Spanish government is expected to approve a plan on Friday to force banks to place toxic real estate assets in holding companies that would later sell them off. The government is also expected to announce demands for the banks to set aside a further 35bn euros ($45bn) to cover sound loans in their real estate portfolios. The government has already forced banks to make provisions of 54bn euros to cover bad assets. "The text is being finalised after talks with the banks," a government source told the Reuters news agency, adding that both the new provisions and the "bad bank" scheme would be approved on Friday.
