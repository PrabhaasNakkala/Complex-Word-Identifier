3W5PY7V3UP86SFDFTYYOJZOIVEFJYF	Sunday's parliamentary vote suggested Russians are tiring of Putin and his United Russia party. Preliminary results indicate the party won less than 50 percent of votes, a steep fall from its earlier majority. Some opposition parties and international observers said the poll was marred by widespread reports and allegations of vote-rigging. The allegations have fired up the opposition, which has long seen its protests crushed and its pleas ignored by the Kremlin-dominated media. On Facebook, more than 10,000 people signed up to a page announcing an opposition rally for Saturday. Although Sunday's election results signal that Putin's return to the presidency in next March's election may not be as easy as he expected, he has downplayed the reduced majority. He said it was ``inevitable'' because voters always are unhappy with the party in power.

3SCKNODZ0XHJWL8ZLN0GZTL2ZYN7NF	"As we emerge from a decade of conflict abroad and economic crisis at home, it is time to renew America," Obama said. The agreement pledges ongoing U.S. support for Afghanistan after 88,000 U.S. combat forces leave. The pact envisions wide-ranging U.S. involvement in Afghan economic and security affairs for a decade, if only as an adviser or underwriter. It gives Afghans a promise of more roads and schools and support for the uneven Afghan fighting forces. It gives the U.S. a security foothold in the country to bolster Afghan forces for their continued fight against Taliban-led militants or al-Qaida, and to keep an eye on neighboring Iran. Obama's emphasis on a long-term U.S. commitment to Afghanistan reflects a lingering worry about the threat of a Taliban resurgence after 2014, when U.S. and NATO combat forces are scheduled to leave.

351S7I5UG9XCGG91MWPD2JQBQH8NJZ	Because the government is strapped for cash, it has little room to help rescue the country's banks. Fears that public finances might be overwhelmed by bailing out banks have led investors to consider Spain the next most likely European country to need an international bailout. The government earlier this week nationalized Bankia SA, the country's fourth-largest bank and the one with the highest exposure to bad property loans and other assets following a crash in the construction sector in 2008. The Bank of Spain estimates that Spanish banks are sitting on some €184 billion in 'problematic" assets, either loans or foreclosed property. Bankia alone is estimated to hold €32 billion ($41.3 billion) of these assets. On Wednesday, the government said it was taking control of Bankia by converting into shares the €4.5 billion ($5.8 billion) in loans it gave the entity in 2011 to fund its creation through a merger of regional savings banks.
