3JAOYN9IHL3URYE21SDBDYBGTFV33F	The discovery of deuterium-burning down to 0.012 solar masses and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer atmospheres of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question . This discovery helped to establish yet another spectral class even cooler than L dwarfs , known as `` T dwarfs '' , for which Gliese 229B is the prototype . Remarkably , its near-infrared spectrum clearly exhibited a methane absorption band at 2 micrometres , a feature that had previously only been observed in the atmospheres of giant planets and that of Saturn 's moon Titan . Although the discovery of the coolest dwarf was highly significant at the time , it was debated whether GD 165B would be classified as a brown dwarf or simply a very-low-mass star , because observationally it is very difficult to distinguish between the two .

3EQVJH0T40MEKNJVVS84Z5GO6JQHTH	This is due to two competing physical effects : gravity , which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground ; and the heat content of the air , which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand . On the flight deck , the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter , which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance ( feet or metres ) instead of atmospheric pressure . The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster , having a higher heart rate , and adjusting its blood chemistry . Because of the lower pressure , the air expands as it rises , which causes it to cool .

Mucha volunteered to produce a lithographed poster within two weeks , and on 1 January 1895 , the advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou was posted in the city , where it attracted much attention . Bernhardt was so satisfied with the success of this first poster that she began a six-year contract with Mucha . 
3VDI8GSXAFUHM7WW8OFRN980D6S8GK	The word actor refers to a person who acts regardless of gender , and this term `` is increasingly preferred '' , while actress refers specifically to a female person who acts . The first recorded case of an actor performing took place in 534 BC ( though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly ) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped on to the stage at the Theatre Dionysus and became the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story . Prior to Thespis ' act , stories were only known to be told in song and dance and in third person narrative . In the ancient Greece and Rome and the medieval world , it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage , and this belief persisted until the 17th century , when in Venice it was broken .

3YZ7A3YHR5U1PUML5Q2503HCZRLS5M	It is known from a well preserved partial skeleton that includes four long feathers on the tail , composed of a central rachis and vanes . Zhang et al. suggest that unless Epidexipteryx evolved from flying ancestors and subsequently lost its wings , this may indicate that advanced display feathers on the tail may have predated flying or gliding flight . It had teeth only in the front of the jaws , with unusually long front teeth angled forward , a feature only seen in Masiakasaurus among other theropods . In all , the skeleton of Epidexipteryx hui measures 25 centimeters ( 10 inches ) in length ( 44.5 cm or 17.5 in including the incomplete tail feathers ) , and the authors estimated a weight of 164 grams , smaller than most other basal avialans .

34ZTTGSNJXP1S7R3EOE9U051MCRHQ3	The spectrum of the companion GD 165B was very red and enigmatic , showing none of the features expected of a low-mass red dwarf star . The difference between a very-low-mass brown dwarf and a giant planet ( ~ 13 Jupiter masses ) has been recently debated . Early theories concerning the nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a Population I object with a mass less than 0.07 solar masses or a Population II object less than 0.09 solar masses would never go through normal stellar evolution and would become a completely degenerate star ( Kumar 1963 ) . True stars burn their lithium within a little over 100 Myr , whereas brown dwarfs ( which can , confusingly , have temperatures and luminosities similar to true stars ) will not .

The stretch of DNA transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a transcription unit and encodes at least one gene . The other DNA strand ( the non-template strand ) is called the coding strand , because its sequence is the same as the newly created RNA transcript ( except for the substitution of uracil for thymine ) . During transcription , a DNA sequence is read by an RNA polymerase , which produces a complementary , antiparallel RNA strand called a primary transcript .

3QI9WAYOGQCX8YMZA9CAS9VCVMWS62	The tail of Epidexipteryx also bore unusual vertebrae towards the tip which resembled the feather-anchoring pygostyle of modern birds and some oviraptorosaurs . Epidexipteryx also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers , composed of parallel barbs as in more primitive feathered dinosaurs . However , unlike in modern-style rectrices ( tail feathers ) , the vanes were not branched into individual filaments but made up of a single ribbon-like sheet . It has been reported to be a maniraptoran dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic or Upper Jurassic age Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia , China ( about 160 or 168 mya ) . Epidexipteryx ( `` display feather '' ) is a genus of small paravian dinosaur , known from one fossil specimen in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing . 
36JW4WBR06L41I1U083FI11NFAIFH7	Medicine recognizes that altitudes above 1,500 metres ( 4,900 ft ) start to affect humans , and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above 5,500-6 ,000 metres ( 18,000-19 ,700 ft ) for more than two years . There are several types of aviation altitude : These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude : The Earth 's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions : Regions on the Earth 's surface ( or in its atmosphere ) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude . Aviation altitude is measured using either Mean Sea Level ( MSL ) or local ground level ( Above Ground Level , or AGL ) as the reference datum .
